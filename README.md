# Standalone Vector VRL Playground.

At some point I realized that I needed a Vector VRL playground separate from the full distribution. With all due respect to the developers of Vector, I want to share my humble work with the community.

"Why? For what?"
It was 'developed' for case of internal usage, I hope it would be helpful for somebody.
It works without Internet access, and installation of Vector itself isn't neccessary.

* Vector Github: https://github.com/vectordotdev

## Requirements
Tested with built-in python3 in CentOS 8 and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. That's all you need.

## Usage
Download zip, extract it somewhere and run ```python3 -m http.server``` in extracted folder. Then open your browser at http://localhost:8000/ or any other port you confire for Python HTTP server. Enjoy :)

## Thoughts
I'm open to bug reports, failures and ideas, feel free to open issue.
